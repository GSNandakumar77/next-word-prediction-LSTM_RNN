# Next Word Prediction Using LSTM

This project implements a deep learning model to predict the **next word in a given sequence of text**, trained on Shakespeare's *Hamlet*.  
It uses **Embedding + LSTM layers** and is deployed with **Streamlit** for interactive real-time predictions.

## Key Features
- Preprocessing of Shakespeare's *Hamlet* dataset
- Embedding layer for word representation
- Stacked LSTM layers for sequence modeling
- Softmax output layer for next-word prediction
- Early stopping to prevent overfitting
- Streamlit web app for user-friendly deployment
